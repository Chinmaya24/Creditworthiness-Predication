## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Features

Extend the feature engineering in `feature_engineering.py`:

```python
def _create_custom_features(self, X):
    # Add your custom feature creation logic
    X['custom_feature'] = X['feature1'] / X['feature2']
    return X
```

### Adding New Models

Extend the model training in `credit_models.py`:

```python
model_configs = {
    'your_model': {
        'model': YourModelClass(),
        'params': {'param1': [value1, value2]}
    }
}
```

### Custom Data

Replace synthetic data generation with your own dataset:

```python
# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_credit_data.csv')

# Ensure target column is named 'creditworthy'
# Ensure all required features are present
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Limitations

- **Educational Purpose**: This system is designed for learning and demonstration
- **Synthetic Data**: Uses generated data; real-world performance may vary
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Real credit decisions require additional factors and compliance
- **Domain Expertise**: Always validate predictions with financial experts
